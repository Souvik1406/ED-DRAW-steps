Here are the detailed steps for each of the problems:

### 1) Diagonal Scale Construction:
**Problem Statement**: The area of a field is 50000 m². The length and breadth of the field on the drawing sheet are 10 cm and 8 cm, respectively. Construct a diagonal scale that reads up to 400 meters. Find the R.F. of the scale and mark distances of 235 meters and 324 meters on it.

**Steps**:

1. **Calculate the Actual Length and Breadth**:
   - The area of the field is given as 50000 m².
   - Assuming the field is rectangular, if the length is \( L \) and the breadth is \( B \), then:
     \[
     L \times B = 50000 \, \text{m}^2
     \]
   - Given the length and breadth on the drawing are 10 cm and 8 cm, convert these into meters:
     \[
     L_d = 0.1 \, \text{m}, \quad B_d = 0.08 \, \text{m}
     \]
   - Calculate the R.F.:
     \[
     R.F. = \frac{L_d}{L} = \frac{0.1 \, \text{m}}{L} \quad \text{and similarly for breadth}
     \]
   - Use the area to find the real dimensions:
     \[
     \frac{L \times B}{R.F.^2} = 50000 \, \text{m}^2
     \]
     \[
     L = \sqrt{\frac{50000}{\left(\frac{8}{10}\right)}} \approx 223.6 \, \text{m}
     \]
   - Therefore, the R.F. is:
     \[
     R.F. = \frac{0.1 \, \text{m}}{223.6 \, \text{m}} \approx \frac{1}{2236}
     \]

2. **Construct the Scale**:
   - Determine the length of the scale to represent 400 meters.
     \[
     \text{Scale length} = \frac{400 \, \text{m}}{2236} \approx 0.179 \, \text{m} = 17.9 \, \text{cm}
     \]
   - Draw a horizontal line of 17.9 cm.

3. **Subdivide the Scale**:
   - Divide this 17.9 cm line into four equal parts, each representing 100 meters.
   - Further divide one of these 100-meter divisions into 10 equal parts, each representing 10 meters.

4. **Construct Diagonal Scale**:
   - At the 0-meter mark, draw a vertical line of 1 cm height.
   - Divide this vertical line into 10 equal parts.
   - From each subdivision, draw diagonal lines to the next 10-meter subdivision on the horizontal scale.

5. **Mark the Distances**:
   - **For 235 meters**: Locate the 230-meter mark on the main scale. From this point, move up along the diagonal scale to the 5-meter mark.
   - **For 324 meters**: Locate the 320-meter mark on the main scale. From this point, move up along the diagonal scale to the 4-meter mark.

### 2) Locus of Point 'A' on a Rolling Circle (Cycloid):
**Problem Statement**: A circular wheel of diameter 35 mm rolls on a straight line without slipping. A point 'A' lies on the rim of the wheel. Draw the locus of point 'A' for one revolution and the tangent and normal at point P.

**Steps**:

1. **Draw the Base Line**:
   - Draw a horizontal straight line representing the path on which the wheel rolls.

2. **Draw the Circle**:
   - Draw a circle with a diameter of 35 mm to represent the wheel.
   - Mark a point 'A' on the circumference of the circle.

3. **Divide the Circle**:
   - Divide the circle into 12 equal parts by drawing radial lines from the center.
   - Number these divisions clockwise.

4. **Generate the Cycloid**:
   - Roll the wheel along the base line. For each division, the center of the circle moves horizontally by a distance equal to the arc length between the divisions.
     \[
     \text{Distance moved} = \text{Arc length} = \frac{\pi \times \text{Diameter}}{12}
     \]
   - Plot the new position of point 'A' after each division.
   - Continue until the circle has made one complete revolution.

5. **Draw the Cycloid**:
   - Connect all the plotted points smoothly to form the cycloid curve.

6. **Draw Tangent and Normal**:
   - Identify point P on the cycloid.
   - At point P, draw a line from the center of the circle to P (this is the radius).
   - The normal at point P is perpendicular to the tangent at the point where the circle touches the base line.
   - Draw a perpendicular line from the point where the circle touches the base line to get the tangent.

### 3) Locus of a Point on a Rolling Circle (Epicycloid):
**Problem Statement**: A circle of 50 mm diameter rolls on the circumference of another circle of 175 mm diameter and outside it. Trace the locus of a point on the rolling circle's circumference for one revolution and name the curve.

**Steps**:

1. **Draw the Fixed Circle**:
   - Draw a circle with a 175 mm diameter.

2. **Draw the Rolling Circle**:
   - Draw another circle with a 50 mm diameter tangent to the outer side of the fixed circle.

3. **Divide Both Circles**:
   - Divide both the fixed and rolling circles into an equal number of parts (12 parts).
   - Label the divisions on the rolling circle.

4. **Generate the Epicycloid**:
   - Start rolling the circle along the circumference of the fixed circle without slipping.
   - For each step, move the rolling circle and mark the position of the corresponding point on its circumference.
   - Continue this until the circle completes one full revolution.

5. **Trace the Epicycloid**:
   - Join the traced points to form the epicycloid curve.

6. **Draw Tangent and Normal**:
   - At point P on the curve, draw a radius to the center of the rolling circle.
   - The normal is perpendicular to this radius.
   - The tangent is perpendicular to the normal.

### 4) Locus of a Point on a Rolling Circle Inside a Larger Circle (Hypocycloid):
**Problem Statement**: A rolling circle of diameter 25 mm rolls inside a base circle of radius 100 mm. Trace the locus of a point on the rolling circle for one complete revolution.

**Steps**:

1. **Draw the Base Circle**:
   - Draw a circle with a radius of 100 mm.

2. **Draw the Rolling Circle**:
   - Draw a circle with a 25 mm diameter inside the base circle.

3. **Divide Both Circles**:
   - Divide both circles into 12 equal parts and label the divisions.

4. **Generate the Hypocycloid**:
   - Start rolling the smaller circle along the inside of the larger circle without slipping.
   - For each division, move the rolling circle inside the base circle, marking the locus of a point on its circumference.

5. **Trace the Hypocycloid**:
   - Connect the points to form the hypocycloid.

6. **Draw Tangent and Normal**:
   - Draw the radius of the rolling circle at point P.
   - The normal is perpendicular to this radius, and the tangent is perpendicular to the normal.

### 5) Locus of a Point on a String (Involute):
**Problem Statement**: A string 145 mm long is attached to the circumference of a circular disc of 40 mm diameter. Draw the curve traced by the free end of the string when it is completely wound around the disc.

**Steps**:

1. **Draw the Base Circle**:
   - Draw the circle representing the disc with a 40 mm diameter.

2. **Mark the Starting Point**:
   - Mark the point on the circumference of the circle where the string is attached.

3. **Unwind the String**:
   - Begin unwinding the string from the starting point.
   - For every small segment unwound, the free end of the string moves along the path of the involute.

4. **Trace the Involute**:
   - Continue unwinding the string while marking the position of the free end at each small interval.
   - Connect the points to form the involute curve.

5. **Draw Tangent and Normal**:
   - Draw a line tangent to the curve at point P (the string at that moment).
   - The normal is perpendicular to the tangent.

By following these detailed steps, you can solve each of these engineering drawing problems systematically.
